Notes on teaching basic concepts of programming to parents and kids

# A fun thing to do with your child
Lately I met a friend and she told me that her young son (9 yrs.) is eager to learn programming. I showed her JavaScript and they had great fun with it. That started a process where I would think about teaching code to parents and children. With this page I'd like to introduce you to the concept of creating computer programs that result in colorful graphics or animations. Programming graphics is a fun thing you can do together with your child. You don't need any other tools than your web-browser. 

# Create sketches
Making these little creative things will teach you the most basic concepts of programming along the way. I recommend you to try the p5-web-editor and explore the world of creative coding. All of the code below will run there when you press the play button.
